This is a rare blog post for me as I'm not usually one to reference how-to videos on YouTube but I have recently been watching Craig's videos to really give me a good refresher on the methodology that is TOGAF. I invite others who may be studying towards TOGAF or need a refresher on the methodologies to give these videos a try. Try to make sure you watch all of it through and take notes, especially around the 'Transition Planning' part of the TOGAF ADM cycle. That is where most of the time a IT Solutions Architect or System Engineer will spend his time.

On a bit of a side note it's funny how many who I talk to today that still feel that TOGAF like ITIL and PRINCE2 are those types of fluffy certifications that no on really leverages. While to some extent this may be true, you never really use 100% of the three practices, it's still very handy to have and deploy in your organisation or as part of a transition in IT infrastrcuture. For example you can thank ITIL for Change Management which is now a very common practice in the IT industry!
