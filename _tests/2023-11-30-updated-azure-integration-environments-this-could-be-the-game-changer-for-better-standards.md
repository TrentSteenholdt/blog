As we continue to move away from BizTalk (yep, it’s 2023; we know) the public preview of the **Azure Integration Environment** and **Business Process Tracking** brings a fresh approach to how Logic Apps, API Management and Service Bus seem to continue in this decoupled state. There is a palpable sense of change in the air—one that could potentially redefine how businesses approach integration and process management.

## A Cohesive Canvas

Imagine a place where the clutter of integration resources is organised into a coherent, logical structure. This is what the Azure Integration Environment is all about. It’s not just a tool; it’s a canvas where businesses can paint their processes and integrations in alignment with their internal frameworks and identities. Whether it’s a finely-tuned production environment or a department-specific resource grouping like Finance or Marketing, the flexibility is unprecedented.

## Clarity in Complexity

With Business Process Tracking, Azure brings a new lens to view transactions within Logic Apps. Businesses can now illuminate the often complex pathways of their operations, providing stakeholders with a clear view of the journey from start to finish. This isn’t just a feature; it’s a simplifier, designed to distill complexity into clarity.

## Game-Changing Potential

Once this preview phase concludes, we’re looking at what could be a watershed moment for business process management. The integration of these services has the potential to elevate governance and set new standards—moving us away from the all-too-common “if it works, don’t touch it” mentality that can stunt innovation and risk resilience.

## Bridging Development and Operations

The divide between development teams and the platform or operations teams tasked with maintenance has often been wide. However, with the advent of these new Azure services, that gap should narrow. We’re talking about a closer collaboration, where developers and operations teams can coalesce around a shared, streamlined platform.

For a more in-depth dive into what these changes entail, and how they might reshape the Azure landscape, I highly recommend reading Kent’s comprehensive post on the [Microsoft tech community](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/azure-integration-services-blog/introducing-azure-integration-environment-amp-business-process/ba-p/3976237). It’s a treasure trove of insights for those who want to understand the nitty-gritty of this evolution.
