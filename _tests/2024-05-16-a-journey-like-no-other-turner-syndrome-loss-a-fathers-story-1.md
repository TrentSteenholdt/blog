This is part one of a long story. A potential dumping ground and a hot mess. But I invite you to read it. Awareness, as they say, is the often first step to change.

## The beginning

This story starts in September 2023. It's a particular night not too far from my younger brother's birthday on the 27th and smack bang in the middle of my job redundancy. I remember talking to Maree (my wife), on the couch [about the struggles of the year thus far](/2023/12/15/reflecting-on-2023-a-journey-through-turmoil-and-gratitude/). In discussion, a thought of mine was eating at me which I had to get off my chest.

_"Maree, when we're older, I don't want Leila to be alone"_, I said.

Maree and I communicate like any other marriage, sometimes we're excellent, and other times (which can feel like all the time), we're hopeless. This particular night felt like one of those good nights, however. She understood where I was coming from, and what I was inferring with my dad being so unwell recently and my mum not long before that. Personally, in both awful experiences, it was good to have immediate family, my two brothers in particular, around to talk and share/shed load.

It wasn't like we were going to act upon what I said straight away, but it did set us up once things did settle down, around Christmas, to at least think about it.

## The early days

Like any couple, when you kind of decide these things, you have no idea when it's going to happen. Ironically relatives in my family were recently made aware of some fertility challenges, and Maree and I did wonder if it would even happen because it could be an issue for us. That being said, we had no issues with our first so surely our second will be the same.

Needless to say, we just went about life as normal. Matter of fact, in January 2024, two years following the birth of our first daughter Leila, Maree was starting to build a newfound confidence to reignite her theatre and acting career. As someone who had recently just switched to 4-day work weeks to pursue other interests outside of IT, I was super excited for her. In a matter of days, auditions and opportunities were coming in fast. Amazing!

## Wow, Maree's pregnant; um that was quick

It was probably less than three weeks with this newfound confidence when one afternoon, I received the faintest of knocks on my office door. Knowing that Leila had just learnt how to knock I expected her to enter the room (she learnt to open doors way earlier), but as I turned around...

"We have a situation", Maree said in the doorway while holding a pregnancy test looking like she had lost everything dear to her.

The look Maree had was like the life was sucked away from her. It was gut-wrenching and devasting to see. As the people pleaser I am, I remember immediately rebuking...

"It's going to be okay. This is great news".

I'm not sure my choice of words was right, because not long after that, Maree was in tears. That hit me really hard; it struck a cord that hurt the vulnerable child in me. Unlike when we found out with Leila, where understandably we were shocked but had tears of joy, this felt so different... It honestly felt wrong.

I remember telling Maree to call her parents and let them know, hoping they might help with the situation. She did, and I, unlike last time when I didn't tell anyone (except my younger brother accidentally) went over and told my parents as I was so conflicted, hurt and just honestly confused. Maree was in tears, like in mourning, but I was so excited and jubilated. Dad and Mum congratulated me and made me feel so much better.

The next few days were normal like any pregnancy, go see a GP (doctor) and confirm the at-home test results. Maree hates this as GPs have to ask the legal questions of "Is this a wanted pregnancy?" etc. and I'll agree the experience we had when pregnant with Leila was horrid; it was like the doctor wanted us to terminate for no reason. This time I thought the experience was great, much more pro-pregnancy than the opposite. Again, however, Maree had a different reaction.

I remember thinking how odd Maree and I are seeing it differently but I'm sure it will iron itself out.

## Your HCG bloods are high, it could be twins

Not long later the blood results came back and confirmed that in fact, Maree was pregnant. It wasn't the same day, but maybe a couple of days later when the doctor had said to Maree, "Oh your blood was a little high in HCG score, it could be twins" ðŸš© which only further compounded the happiness I had, and what I could only describe was a sadness of loss for Maree.

We played along with it. I remember messaging Maree all the time...

"How's you?"  
"How's boo?" (what we call Leila)  
"How's boo two?" (what we were calling baby #2)  
"How's boo three?" (what I was calling baby #3)

She would reply back with some witty humour and we played to our strongest trait in our marriage, fun and amusement.

As this was our second pregnancy, we didn't opt for an early ultrasound like we did with Leila. It was just easier to wait for the first useful scan at ~11 weeks, the [nuchal translucency scan](https://www.pregnancybirthbaby.org.au/nuchal-translucency-scan). A scan that was so normal for Leila that I didn't even know it was a scan where they did important measurements.

Maree went to this appointment on her own as I was busy with a work meeting, something I'll regret for the rest of my life, but when she came home I was eager to know...

"How was it?"  
"How is the baby?"  
"What was the heart rate?"  
"What did they say?"

Maree, unusually, replied...

"I don't know, they didn't say anything. They just said they'll send the results to the doctor"
