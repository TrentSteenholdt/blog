## Call the army

I alerted everyone, including close friends and even my psychologist. Everyone needed to know. Many of the replies were of shock, some of sorrow, and some 'Oh you have closure' (annoyingly)....

## Waiting for paperwork

Being so late in the day, we had an issue. The ultrasound place had to send the results back to the GP who referred us. Kind of useless this time of the day as it would have been waiting till tomorrow… No chance you could just go home with that news.

The doctor at the ultrasound place is a bit confused and worried about what to do. I mentioned we're also in the King Edwards' system and she's relieved.

"Okay, good," she says.

"I'll need to figure out how to get you a printed report and I think you should go there now", she confirmed.

"Yep, makes sense, we'll call them" I replied.

Maree and I left our paperwork at home. Needless to say, it wasn't hard for me to find the number for the hospital. I got a young lady on the other end. I explained the whole situation and in particular pointed out the gestational age.

"Okay so you're under 20 weeks, we can't help you", she replied.

Knowing this was likely as we were informed only a week earlier that under this age, any hospital is appropriate we decided we'd just go to Fiona Stanley. That being said, we did go home quickly to try the other number we were given. It rang out.

## Waiting for 'be right backs'

We arrive at Fiona Stanley Hospital. The emergency department is packed. The volunteers at the front door ask how they can help.

"We have lost the heartbeat of our unborn daughter" I simply said.

They replied. "Take a seat in the red chairs over there".

It was less than five minutes, and we were seen by a triage nurse.

"How can I help?", she said.

"We have lost the heartbeat of our unborn daughter. King Edwards said to come here."

She looks back with a confused look.

"Sorry, what? You're with King Edwards?" she replied.

"Yeah, the baby has suspected Turner syndrome. We also know she was very unwell", I confirmed.

"Umm, so why are you not there? You should be there. Hang on, I need to take this paperwork and I come right back", as she got out of her chair and went into the other room.

A minute or two later, she was back, this time on the patient's side with us. While she was away a little old lady was complaining to the other triage nurse about the wait time. She had waited some five hours and still hadn't been seen. Okay, we were clearly a priority one.

"I just spoke to our gynaecology unit, you need to be at King Edwards".

## King Edwards

As we got back in the car to go to King Edwards, Maree and I started talking about our grief. That was incredibly cathartic for me. The start of a journey no couple should ever have to take together.

We arrived at King Edwards, and there was parking right at the front door. A first as parking is a nightmare. We went straight inside and found this was definitely the right place to be. The triage midwife was so kind and understood what we were going through. At this point, I was doing a lot of the talking as Maree couldn't string a sentence together to save herself. Understandable given what she's been through in the last seven weeks and more obviously in the last two hours.

The wait at King Edwards was long. I knew already it was very unlikely anything would happen tonight except, confirmation of fetal demise and checking Maree's vital to make sure she was stable enough to leave the hospital. Her blood pressure, heart rate and O2's were perfect. Seeing 100 O2 when Dad could get barely 94 last year was assuring for me.

After a mistake by one doctor confusing us with another patient, we finally got seen by our actual assigned doctor a few hours later. Maree was baffled as this was a new experience for her but I knew what to expect with everything that happened to my Dad. Waiting for answers is a game of patience and shift changes is paying tax monopoly cards in buildings like these. Timing is sometimes unlucky.

The doctor came in and sat down with us.
