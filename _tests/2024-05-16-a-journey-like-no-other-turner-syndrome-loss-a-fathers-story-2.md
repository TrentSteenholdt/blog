This is Part Two. [One](/2024/05/16/a-journey-like-no-other-turner-syndrome-loss-a-fathers-story-1/) are here.

## Red Flag Alert

Internally, at this point, I lost it; I was in sheer panic. I immediately knew based on everything that has happened in my family over the last few years that when someone in medicine doesn't say anything in a situation you expect something, there is always something wrong.

Not to alarm Maree, though I think she knew, I asked when she was planning to see the doctor.  
  
"I don't know, I guess they'll call me?" she quipped.

## Sorry, something doesn't look right

Over the next few days, the red flags continued to roll in. Between Maree calling the GP multiple times wondering when someone would share the results, to them finally calling back and saying "When can you next come in?". It felt like to me it was an endless shitstorm rolling in.

Again Maree went to this doctor's appointment alone (well with Leila; so probably worse than going alone). Something again I'll regret for the rest of my life putting silly work meetings over family.

Her appointment was quite early in the day, around 9:15am. I remember that day having a coffee at the local cafe after my conflicting morning meeting. As I was walking back, I got a call.

"Maree Stedul" it read on my screen

### Fuck. Maree never calls

I knew it was bad.

"Where are you?" Maree asked.

In sheer panic, I replied "At the school", inferring the school across the road from where I was...

"At the school? What school?" She replied, confused I'd be at a school...

"Sorry, I'm walking home from Jaylea's [cafe], I'm walking past the school. What's wrong?" I quickly replied back.

"Well, okay, there is no easy way to say this, there is something wrong with the baby." she sharply responded; at least it felt sharp.

"Okay, I'll be home soon" I replied and hung up.

## Regretful Hour

Regret number three right there... I hung up without saying "It's okay", "I'm sorry", or even a "I love you".

As a man, with a toxic perfectionist quality, my mind went immediately into solution mode. Great for a high-pressure job where customers are paying millions of dollars on the cloud bills, but not useful at all in this scenario. I spiralled thinking about all the options including options that I knew Maree would never think of. As a husband, I just wanted to support my wife and the family in what was a horrible situation but didn't know what to do.

When I got home, data-guy me wanted to know all the details. Asking Maree all the specifics of her conversation with the doctor only thirty minutes earlier.

"What was the NT measurement?"  
"What were the other issues?"  
"What words did the doctor use?"

What I got back was a whole lot of nothing. "Ah Sorry, I don't know, I just remember it was a big neck" which was immensely frustrating and above all else, annoying. Annoying because I know if I was there, I would have gotten all these questions answered.

Because Maree went alone, it was not like I could now call her GP and ask for her to speak to me, so I had to 'use' Maree to get what I needed. This was understandably an error of judgement. When she needed a husband to lean on, all she got was a data boy wanting inputs to understand what output it could be. It was like I was a computer beeping nonsense at her.

Needless to say, I did get the answers.

- Gestation was 10 weeks, 6 days.

- Nasal bone was evident but unmeasurable.

- NT was 3.9mm. In Australia, anything over 3.5mm is considered a higher risk.

- HCG blood score was very high, and with only one baby in utero, this suggests chromosomal abnormalities.

This all had the soft markers [for Down Syndrome](https://www.healthline.com/health/soft-markers-for-down-syndrome).

What followed that next hour or so was probably the most hurtful hour of our marriage. When it was a time in a desperate need to turn towards each other, it became a time where no matter what each other said, it was just putting more wedges between us. It was like we were hearing the worst from either side.

I recall sitting at my desk with Maree alongside, trying to get our bloody printer working to print a referral for the next thing we needed to do a [Harmony/NIPT](https://antenatal.clinicallabs.com.au/patient/harmony) test. Something that Maree was strongly against while pregnant with Leila but was now okay with doing. This alone angered me as I worried all through Leila's pregnancy about that "what if" and now I get to know in this situation. Sometimes it's just easier to pick battles you know won't end in bloodshed, right? I'm not sure.

Anyways, while struggling to fix the simplest of printer issues, and trying for what was probably a good 20 minutes, I remember the rush of demise in my mind... _Trent, you can't even fix a fucking damn printer right now... If you can't even do that, how can you raise a child with an issue!_

That internal dialogue is what I should have said out loud... I was hurting immensely inside... Sadly as a faulted man, doing what any man does, trying their best to be strong for the ones they cares for I instead something like:

"I can't do this, I can't have a baby with a disability"

I don't know if that's what I actually said, but all I remember Maree saying in reply...

**"I will raise this baby with or without you".**
