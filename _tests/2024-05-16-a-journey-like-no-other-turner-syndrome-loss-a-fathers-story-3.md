This is Part Three. [One](/2024/05/16/a-journey-like-no-other-turner-syndrome-loss-a-fathers-story-1/), and [two](/2024/05/16/a-journey-like-no-other-turner-syndrome-loss-a-fathers-story-2/) are here.

## The agony days

The words Maree said triggered me much like I likely triggered her. I think it would trigger anyone. I was nothing but red, seething rage. All I could think about was how she was willing to kick me to the curb for my own baby! What happens to Leila and me... Like how could she?! Again, I'm sure she felt the same but for other reasons personal to her.

Later that day, I had enough stewing. I honestly lost it and just said.

"Maree, I'm sorry, but I'm just really angry right now".

I didn't say why. I wasn't brave enough. Though even me saying that was probably something I wouldn't have done years earlier... As you grow older, you do grow wiser; sometimes just not quick enough.

Then I chose to escape to my office, I plonked myself on Google, Reddit and other forums and started reading.

## Sponge Trent Activated

For those who know me, I am like a sponge when it comes to learning something new. It's what makes me a great handyman, great at developing code, a great consultant, great at knowing everything about my Dad's five major surgeries in the last year.... that kind of stuff... Don't ask me how I store it all, but I do.

Seething with anger, I sat down at my computer around 4pm and began reading. By 6am, I was at the point where my eyelids couldn't stay open. However, that's when I learnt:

- NIPT Tests will take 5-10 business days in Australia to be processed.

- NIPT Tests though very reliable these days for trisomies, aren't so great at other chromosomal abnormalities with many recorded false positives.

- NIPT is all about probability. It's a statistics game that measures you to other data they have.

- [NIPT cannot be 100% accurate](https://www.sonicgenetics.com.au/our-tests/doctor-resources/understanding-an-incomplete-nipt-result/), it's not testing the baby itself, but fragments of the baby's DNA in the maternal mother's blood.

- CVS and amniocentesis, are the only way to know with certainty your baby has actually got a chromosomal abnormality or some other underlying issue. However, these aren't a suitable option until ~16 weeks gestation. So there is a gap between doing NIPT, NT scan and these tests that will fill you with nothing but time-waiting anxiety.

- Chromosomal abnormalities are like a spectrum. You can be severely impacted by it, or it could be so minor (low [mosaic](https://www.yalemedicine.org/conditions/mosaicism#:~:text=Mosaicism%20occurs%20when%20a%20person,the%20brain%2C%20or%20other%20organs.)) that you may never know you're impacted.

- Stories of loss from babies in remote Ohio, Manilla and everywhere in between. I started to take on pain of the losses others had.

This new Trent was prepared for every scenario and knew every outcome, but that is not something I would recommend to people. Even though it gave me some added hope the odds were for Maree, Leila and me (3.9mm NT, High HCG bloods together are not horrible numbers, other babies have had worse and made it), it did doomsday shock me with all the **What If's**.

6AM that day was an important day**.** It was **Good Friday**. Maree, a devoted Catholic would have probably needed me that day to look after Leila, but instead, I was crashed in bed asleep. By the time I woke up, it was 11am and I felt horrible that I again wasn't there for Maree. I felt ashamed, a moron and just outright lost because now I had all these **What If's** playing in my head and Maree is and always will be the last person that wants to hear that stuff... opposites attract.

So, given the circumstances, I did what any man does in these kinds of lost causes situations. I got in the car and drove. Two hours later, I was in Lancelin, then Gingin. Later that night I was at Victoria Park McDonalds wondering if I should go home. I eventually did.

## Easter

The Easter weekend was a disaster though we did what was best for Leila and managed to spend some quality time together on Easter Sunday. It was meant to be the point when Maree and I had planned some weeks earlier that we'd tell everyone she was pregnant, but instead, it was like deafening silence. That was hard. Though I think we both at that point had started secretly telling some people like brothers, sisters and really close friends that Maree was pregnant but something was awry.

Ultimately, it was really hard celebrating not knowing what was around the corner. For me, someone who thrives on control (400+ games umpiring cricket controlling players; not the greatest way to grow up), that was harder to take than others like Maree were dealing with it.

My mother-in-law, bless her, when giving me a big hug while I was sobbing in tears said "Maybe you should have a little faith". I know she meant well, but as a man who doesn't have faith or has ever turned to faith, the last thing I felt at that moment was trying to 'barter' or 'ask for help' with the guy upstairs. What I wanted was answers...
