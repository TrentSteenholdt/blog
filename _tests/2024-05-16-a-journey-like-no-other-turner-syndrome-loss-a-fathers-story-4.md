## The lost hope

It's now Easter Tuesday. Maree has finally got the blood test done for the Harmony/NIPT. We were prepared to not hear anything for two weeks, but Monday week came by...

"Trent the doctors just called, telehealth at 1:30pm", said Maree while coming into the office.

With joy, I jumped!

"Telehealth, that's fantastic news", I replied.

"Why?", said Maree.

"Because telehealth means it's good news, they don't want to see you..." I responded thinking how can you not know this...

"Oh well they wanted me to come in but with Leila, it was easier to do telehealth", she replied. ðŸš©

**My heart sank**. Bless Maree, but my gosh she is sometimes a mole with their head in the sand and that irritates me. I couldn't understand how she didn't know that them asking for her to go was a fact they had bad news to share.

When Maree got this phone call, it was 11am, so the next couple of hours were long. We waited and waited, eventually lying on the bed together. It's 1:35pm and my smart watch goes off like crazy "_You're resting and your heart rate is over 130bpm, seek urgent medical attention_".... Yep, well nothing I can do about it now.

## 1:47pm, the call comes into Maree's phone

"Hi Maree, how are you? We have your results with us here, are you with someone right now?" the doctor asked.

"Yes, I'm okay. I'm here with my husband", Maree replied.

"Okay, that's good. So I have information here that I can only share with you that will reveal the sex of your baby even though you opted not to find out the sex". The doctor said.

## I know

Time stopped for me at this point. With the doctor saying that alone, it was enough for me to know what it was. It's [Turner's Syndrome](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/turner-syndrome/symptoms-causes/syc-20360782). I'm in shock.

"Okay, then". Maree nervously replies.

"Okay, so your baby has come back with high probability for monosomy X which means they don't have the second X or Y chromosome on the 23rd pair. That means she is a girl". The doctor quoted.

## My heart sank

Monsonomy X. Fuck; the odds I immediately thought. I knew. 99% of babies with Turners don't make it. I was hoping she would say mosaic or partial loss of the 23rd pair but no. I was mortified and I started to internally grieve while Maree on the other side of the bed while holding back tears says...

"It's a girl!"

I immediately went for my phone. Even though I knew all the answers, risks, chances, complications, and limitations already. I immediately messaged the families' WhatsApp groups "turners syndrome" and then hit Google to search for it. Without needing to even look at anything I turned to Maree and said.

"It's okay, there is no retardation with Turners".

I knew that wasn't true, because there are still some chances of it happening (albeit less than trisomies) but I said it to relieve Maree as I think she felt that was what my worry was at that time. It was before, but it wasn't now. Now it was figuring out how the hell I walk this rope without instilling fear or lost hope into Maree who wants to soldier on in this pregnancy no matter what.

We hung up the call and hugged each other. At this point, I message the same family chat to ask my Mum and Dad to come to our place to talk about it. Not long after Mum arrived without Dad and without hesitation, Mum blurts out something about living for only 13 years. Well of course, they Googled it and they got it the wrong way around and didn't realise that was the reduction of normal life term (so 70 years minus 13) and not 13 years maximum. Needless to say, I got Mum to go back home and get Dad as I didn't want him to feel like that was our fate.

## Back to the odds

After a few moments and gathering my own internal thoughts all while copying and pasting lots of information to inform everyone about Turner syndrome (short stature, webbed neck, heart issues etc.) I started to regain some hope.

NIPT accuracy for [monosomy X is quite low](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8777823/), around 40% depending on which research paper you read. With that, I held onto the hope it was a false positive, even though the other soft markers of NT/NF measurement and blood HCG were not good signs it was.

Following the news, we were referred via the public health system to Genetic Counselling something you don't appreciate exists for all Australians with no out-of-pocket expenses. Obviously, Maree and I would have preferred private, but in this abnormal circumstance, there are steps and procedures to follow and private health won't help you. We tried, but the private obstetricians wouldn't help us.

It's also worth calling out that counselling in this context is not the same as a counsellor like a psych visit. It's about giving you information about your baby's progress and the genetic conditions they may have.
