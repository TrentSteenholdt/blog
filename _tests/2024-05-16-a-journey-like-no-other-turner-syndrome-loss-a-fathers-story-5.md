## We finally meet her after not meeting them Halo

We're at 13 weeks gestation at this point, and we're now seeing the Doctors and ultrasound specialists at Fiona Stanley Hospital. It's 4:30pm, the last appointment of the day. As we waited, I saw a couple walk out of the rooms into the lobby area. Tears, shock, anger, despair; I saw it all on their faces. The mother was no further along than Maree was showing at this point. The look on the father was just paralysis, not knowing what to do.

At the same moment, a mother on her own was called in, much further along than Maree was with a folder with all this paperwork. I thought, wow, what courage. Even though I had no idea if she was having a complicated pregnancy or not, it could have just been a routine checkup.

As she walked out, she had a good smile on her face but it was at this moment, a sixth sense hit me. We're not going to be so lucky.... We're going to be like that other couple I'll never get to see again.

We're welcomed into the room by the lovely staff and doctors there. In the typical fashion of any GP these days, the NIPT results we had for a week and a bit earlier were not sent across to the Genetic Counselling Health Department. Thankfully Mr 'Sponge' here was able to tell the Doctor everything she needed to know.

The gel goes on Maree's belly and the ultrasound machine is switched on as she presses down with the scanner. There is a massive screen above the bed. As soon as it lights up, I see her and without thinking I blurt.

### "Oh shit, look at the neck"

My first look at our daughter... I knew instantly that was not just 3.9mm anymore. You could just tell. The doctor gave me the biggest death stare almost to interrogate me with eyes only. Calmly, she says...

"Let's just get some more scans done before we confirm what's going on".

Some 15 to 20 minutes pass and the room with about six people is awfully silent. Scanning is vigorous and attentive beyond any normal ultrasound I've ever seen. Quietly watching, I could see they were focusing a lot on the blood flow of her heart. I knew from seeing all the scans they did on Dad last year, that they were looking for good rhythm, correct flow on valves and all the chambers. I could only see two and the 'red' and 'blue' was all over the place.

"Okay, so I'm afraid your baby has what we can see is very likely [hypoplastic left heart syndrome](https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/heartdefects/hlhs.html#:~:text=Hypoplastic%20left%20heart%20syndrome%20\(HLHS,type%20of%20congenital%20heart%20defect.) which is a less common though serious side effect for babies with suspect Turner's." the Doctor started.

"We in this situation, would likely expect your baby to struggle through pregnancy and may not make it. I'm so sorry" she continued.

"What would you like to do? Termination is an option."

## When it's not an option

For Maree, this was not an option. She is a staunch pro-lifer. Her head shook quickly and vigorously.

"Okay, we'll need to see you in a couple of weeks then at King Edwards Memorial Hospital. But I must warn you, please don't come expecting there to be a heartbeat. If you have any bleeding or pains, please go to hospital" she calmly responded.

As I took this all in, I could see Maree was in the first stages of grief. Somewhere I was about a week earlier. This was especially hard, as the different stages of grief give you different viewpoints and I felt along the road she was now treading. We walked out of the room, into the lobby. Maree was in tears and I'm sure I was white and pale as the couple before us. I feel for them as much as I feel for us now; I hope they're okay.

As we drive home, Maree opens with an almighty cry of hurt and sorrow. It was a frequency I never heard from her before. Not long after she between tears says,

"I'll give this baby all the time she has with us".

## It hit me

At that point, it hit me like a train. A father's grief is so different from that of a mother. It's not about faith, or belief, or viewpoint. It was simply a different experience for both.

For me, my focus had been fixated on the future. What and how could we manage this. If we're unwell in the future, will Leila have three people to look after? I had immense guilt for things that may never happen. I don't think that was wrong as a husband, father, and man you want to protect and plan.

At that moment, we both needed not just each other, but everyone to lean on. We both that evening started to talk more, and we started telling others close to us in different ways our story so far.

For the record, and for data-boy me here, the data at 13 weeks was:

- NT measurement up from 3.9mm to 9.4mm

- Edema all over; fetalis hydrops.

- Early signs of hypoplastic left heart syndrome

- Lack of kidneys visible.
