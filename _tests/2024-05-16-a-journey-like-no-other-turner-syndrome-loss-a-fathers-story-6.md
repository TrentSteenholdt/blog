## When hope is lost

It's now May 6th, and we're at King Edwards Memorial Hospital for a follow-up scan. We're the first appointment for the day, 9am. The lobby is empty.

We take a seat but not long after we're brought into a room with an ultrasound machine etc. My first thought was how incredible is this Hospital, standing 100+ years, looking a little tired but no different from any other public hospital we've been to. Not long waiting, a nurse enters the room asking her to follow her. Oh.. this isn't the room, okay.

We move to the other room and there is eight people in the room this time. A couple of medical students from Notre Dame University, where Maree and I met, some head doctors and the doctor we met at Fiona Stanley three weeks earlier.

"It's so lovely to see you, it's great to see you actually," she said.

That filled me with warmth and dread. It was like being given a big bear hug but also underlined with a footnote that this is not a good situation. It wasn't long until we saw her again.

## Your baby is very, very unwell

It was obvious, no doctors needed to be in that room to tell us, you could see her fluid had blown out. However there was still her heart beating away, 154bpm it read. Within a few minutes this time, the same doctor from Fiona Stanley speaks up.

"Maree and Trent, I'm so sorry, but your baby is very, very unwell. The chances of survival at this point are impossible and even if you did make it to term, her hydrops are that bad her lungs will never allow her to breathe."

Nothing prepares you for this. Being told your baby has a beating heart and is growing won't live is something different. It is like the world falls out from underneath you. It's an utter shock and honestly, both Maree and I started the grieving process all over again.

Maree at this point needed to use the bathroom, her bladder full as required. While she was in the room I remember chatting with the doctor.

"Okay, so Maree won't terminate her, faith won't allow her. Is there a risk for her?" I asked.

"Not now, but if the pregnancy were to continue, later on, there is something called Mirror Syndrome." the doctor replied.

"Yep, I know what that is, how far in is that a problem?" I quickly jumped in.

"Oh, you know? Okay well I'll say 24 weeks and on". She answered.

She went on to explain Mirror Syndrome to me anyway until Maree entered the room again. That conversation abruptly dropped.

"Okay so Maree, what would you like to do? Would you like to do further testing like CVS or amniocentesis? Or would you consider the other options?" she asked, inferring termination again.

"We keep going", Maree simply responded while shaking the head and holding back tears.

After a few more details were shared, we were sent back to the room earlier. The nurse who took us there started to talk about 'plans'.

## Plans you don't ever think about

The nurse, though politely and kindly starts to talk us through the next steps. Those next steps talk about what will happen when your baby does die. We're given some numbers to call when we think something isn't right and told where to go if it all goes wrong.

We leave the room and walk past the lobby. What was quiet is now full of people waiting their turn. The thought goes through your mind, how does anyone get to term when there are so many? Your mind honestly wonders.

We go home that morning and we are in mourning. Well at least I was and I think Maree was the same. It's words from a doctor you just donâ€™t want to hear.

For the data boy again, at 16 weeks she had:

- Nuchal Fold (NF) measurement (similar to but not exactly the same as the first trimester NT measurement) is now 31.6mm. Up from 9.4mm.

- The edema/hydrops are now internal, squashing vital organs, as well as external.

- She's measuring some 22 weeks around the abdomen.
