## Living knowing it's the ending

Maree still had hope at this point, it was her way of coping, I guess. Deep down though, she was starting to come to terms with loss. Her grief these next few days was tough. They started to hit home for me too, it was a tough lead-up to Mother's Day.

### Grief is something

No one's grief is the same and nor do I think it is the same every time. My grief started to change at this point. It was something I could control or suppress, to something that I couldn't...

**A wave and ripples on the beach's edge**. That is how I describe it. Sometimes it rolled just enough to stop you in thought. Other times, it washed over you and paralysed you for an hour. Work for me at this point became extremely difficult. A 9 to 5 ended up being like a 9 to 10, 12 to 1, 5 to 7 and so on each day... Tears flowed uncontrollably, filling my glasses up like a bucket... Leila would look at me and I could sense, she was wondering if I was okay.

Leila at this point became a beacon for us both. She was honestly what kept us going during it all. Her smiles, her giggles, and her play times were what we needed. However, at the same time, it would have been nice to just let it all out.

## Mother's Day

Before Mother's Day, I asked Maree how she wanted me to handle it. I remember asking

"Do we celebrate it, do I make a big deal of it?"  
"Do I get Leila to give you something? What do you want?"

Maree, bless her, said let's celebrate like always. For us, that's simple... No big surprises, no gifts, just quality time together.

We started Mother's Day off well. Maree was up well before me and had left home to get a coffee with Leila. A routine she started doing when the news of our number #2 was heading downhill. Without a moment's thought, I got up, made the beds and got into the kitchen. It was time to make a good breakfast for us all.

It was scrambled eggs, and toast. Maree being gluten-free we effectively have two toasters. One for me, one for her. I make sure to adhere to the strict guidelines Maree expects from me.

Breakfast is ready. The eggs are overly salty, I guess I forgot to count or something; usually, my Steenholdt family cooking skills are perfect.

Breakfast nevertheless was good. Leila was good. Maree and I were good.

## 10:30am, the tantrum of all tantrums

Leila is usually so good. She has her moments, but in a few minutes, she's fine. However, this was apocalyptic. Like really bad.... And when Maree and I were internally hurting so much, this was hard to handle.

The screaming, kicking, sulking, hitting, and thrashing was relentless from Leila. Maree was at wit's end and I wasn't far behind. We got her somewhat dressed for lunch down in Fremantle and got her in the car all while she was fighting us like crazy. Maree and I get in, forgetting which one of us locked up the house and we're just exhausted even though the day to celebrate with our mums only just started.

No more than 10 minutes into the drive to Fremantle, Leila's screams turn to quietness. She's put herself to sleep. Okay...

"Maree, I'll drop you off and I'll drive Leila around," I said.

"Oh thank you", she replied.

After dropping Maree off at Benny's [the restaurant], I drove home. No point wasting fuel I thought and Leila was out for the count I assumed.

### Here we go again

As soon as I got home, Leila was wide awake, but like paralysed. It was so weird. It was like she didn't have words to say any more or her brain was in restart. I thought odd; is something up? Is she okay?

I got her into her cot with her favourite dolly and she looked at me.

"Love you, Daddy".  
"Sorry, Muma"

I cried. Why was she saying sorry? Ten seconds later, all hell broke loose again. Kicking, screaming, like in pain but no signs of fever or distress. I just laid down on the bed next to her cot and let her do her thing. It was the first time either of us couldn't help her; we got told this happens in the toddler years.

30 minutes later. She's fine again. I thought at this point, well fuck it, she's had no sleep (maybe 15mins max) but I'll take her back to Fremantle and she was a good little girl for us again. She was a bit bossy demanding a train trip, leaving the restaurant but hey, why not.

### Later that day

It's getting to mid-afternoon; time to switch to my parent's place to be with my mum. Both Maree and I were honestly exhausted, and the whole day was getting to us. It would have been hard with just Leila acting up like she did but we were looking at death right in front of us... But I thought, I better not piss off my mum who can be easily upset over the simplest of things and go.
