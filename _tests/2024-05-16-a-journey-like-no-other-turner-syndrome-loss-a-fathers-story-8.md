## I lose my absolute shit at my mum and older brother

Maree, Leila and I arrive at my Mum and Dad's. I wish my Mum a happy Mother's Day and give her a big cuddle. I remember saying Leila has been an absolute "terrorist" today and what I got back was a shunted response of "leave her alone, she's perfect".

Nothing about today was perfect. It was fundamentally flawed. Maree and I sat on the couch and dumped Leila effectively to do her own thing at "Nanna and Pops" a place she visits regularly and intentionally. It is and forever will be a second home for her.

Meagan, our beautiful sister-in-law is pregnant herself (~30 weeks) sits down on the other couch and talks to Maree with such kindness and grace. It's truly remarkable how some people know what to say, how to say it and do the right things, and then there is others that act just so bizarrely.

Maree is mindful that it's coming close to 5pm and is worried about Leila not having anything decent to eat all day... She didn't eat anything. I said to her okay, we'll go home soon so to get her some proper food, but need to be here just a little while longer as leaving early will ultimately upset my Mum. It wouldn't have been a moment later when Maree did a quick check on Leila, who was eating some chippies/pretzels that she loves to get at Nanna and Pops. Maree accepting fate at this point just said something along the lines of...

"Oh you're eating something, okay" in a way of just accepting it and being totally fine with it. It's happened.

Without delay my mum, from across the room.

"Oh come on, it's just some bloody ice cream cone and chippies. How is that going to hurt her, thank you very much," in a very harsh and arsehole-like tone.

Maree sat down, back next to me on the couch. I knew that hurt her. Maree has the biggest, kindest and warmest heart I know. She wouldn't hurt anyone and her words weren't her blaming my Mum it was just stating facts. Needless to say, I could see the pain in her expression.

I said something along the lines of "sorry" and we continued on trying to grieve internally with shit like that flying...

Then it was my older brother. A man whom I understand very little about and worry about regularly. He's closed off more than anyone but he seems to get a running mouth when he's on some rant. A common scenario for him... It started.

"Fucken Christ the King". A school his daughter attended probably less than a week at.... It's complicated.

"Fucken complete waste of time. It would be fucken nice if they fucken responded to me". Again in the shittiest of tones possible.

I was incredibly irritated. A school I recommended to him as a brother trying to help... A school where all of my in-law's nieces and nephews have gone to and have become beautiful, kind and compassionate people. A school where Maree's sister has volunteered for years at... A school we picked for Leila to go to next year for three-year-old kindy.

I'm thinking just stewing and thinking how about going to see the Principal? I know he is happy to talk, Maree and I saw him only a week earlier for Leila's interview. We thankfully have been accepted.

I couldn't understand how the dickhead couldn't read the room. The two people who helped you with that recommendation, a good school, a school a part of Maree's life so much are already, are sitting in a world of hurt and grief.

"Let's go", I said to Maree.

I got Leila and said goodbyes. My mum gave me one of her occasional 'disgust' glances as I picked Leila up.

As soon as we walked out the front door, I just said

"Maree, I'm so sorry".

Immediately she's in tears. She's really hurting. This day has been so tough on her.

I'm angry. I put Leila in the car seat and buckled her in. Maree is crying her eyes out in the front seat.

"I'll be back in a second"

## I went back inside

There is a saying that I've learnt recently. _Don't let the family you're born into hurt the family you create._

I made my anger and disgust known to both my older brother and Mother. It would have been heard down the street... I don't care at this point.

My younger brother, the kinder one tells me to get out. I do.

## The next day

Monday morning was hard for Maree. I could really tell yesterday was not that pleasant for her. For me, it wasn't very pleasant either.

"Your mum has messaged me, she says sorry". Maree said to me sometime around lunchtime.

"Oh good, I'm relieved". I truly was.
