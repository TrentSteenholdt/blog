## May 14th ðŸ’“

I have my psychology appointment booked for 12:30pm. Much needed as I'm about to run out of energy and the last few sessions have just been a time for me to let it all out. An hour of crying, anger, bardering and sorrow. Maree has scheduled a doctor's appointment at the same time to get onto a [Mental Health Care Plan](https://www.servicesaustralia.gov.au/mental-health-care-and-medicare?context=60092). Something I have been advocating for weeks now.

I get home and Maree has some paperwork and a story to tell.

"So, the doctor was really late and yeah I couldn't wait because of Leila so I cancelled", she said.

"Oh". I repliedâ€¦

"What did you do then?". Referring to the paper in her hand.

"Well, I got a nurse who got another doctor to doppler for a heartbeat. She said she couldn't be sure if there was one. There were some wooshing sounds but that could have been the placenta", she replied.

A pause ensuedâ€¦ she then continuedâ€¦

"So I have this referral at 4pm for an ultrasound down the road".

## Okay, I'm coming

This time, work took a back seat. I had a meeting from 3pm to 4pm but fuck it, this was more importantâ€¦

Maree took Leila to her mums and we got down to the local ultrasound place.

We were a little late, a minute in factâ€¦ Then in line for three further minutes.

"Oh, I can see you're late to this appointment. I'll need to confirm we can still do this" the receptionist said at 4:04pm. Maree looks at me as I've taken a seat, I play dumb but I knew what she had told Maree. I was angry I made us late; though pissed off Maree was getting this run of bad luck.

A phone call later, it was fine. A minute later we're in the the room.

## The gel is on the belly, and the scanner is pressed down

The scans start top-down. It's the baby's head, then her brain then the chest, then the abdomen, then the legs. It goes back up and down.

The room is silent. The ultrasound is silent.

"Oh, she's not here," I think I said.

Maree said something, I don't remember exactly, but it made me cry immediately.

The ultrasound specialist confirms.

**"I'm sorry there is no heartbeat"**

## What now?

We're now in full grief once again. We made no plans to organise for Leila and so on. The ultrasound specialist says there are now procedures they need to follow as kindly and gently as possible. She was great. While this happened, I went into emergency response mode.

I first alerted Maree's sisters. Simply, "no heartbeat. it's happened". Before I could move to my family chat, Silvia (Maree's oldest sister) replied "where are you". "ultrasound" is all I said back.
