Dear Ivie,

I've just gotten to see you. I'm so sorry. ðŸ’”

My heart aches in grief for the card you were dealt. I feel anger, I feel sadness, I feel helplessness. You were my number two daughter I was hoping for. You were the little sister I so wanted Leila to have.

It's peaceful to know you are no longer suffering any pain you may have felt. It's anguish to know your time with us was so unwell, your body showed that pain. As your father, it was my job to protect you from it all. But no matter what I could do, there was nothing I could do. All we could do was wait.

Your Muma, through all of this, wanted you. She fought so hard for you. I love that she gave you that chance. Though not quite right, your heart did beat away for as long as it did. I'm so glad I got to see that and I'm sorry, I didn't get to see it sooner.

You have taught me so much even with the little time I spent with you. You have dug into the depths of resilience I didn't know I had. I am now stronger, wiser and older because of you. I will cherish everything you have taught me.

Your loss is difficult and complicated, it was never going to be easy. Maree, Leila and I are now starting a new chapter in life. One that I can assure you that I'll be thinking every day of what could have been.
