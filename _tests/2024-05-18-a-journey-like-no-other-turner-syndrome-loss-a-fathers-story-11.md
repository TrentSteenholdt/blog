## No detail spared

Our doctor is dressed in all green robes. She's Irish (the doctor earlier too). She's so sweet, kind, emphatic and warm. She's well-trained.

The details shared were detailed and thorough. Maree was glassy-eyed, confused and scared. I comforted her as best I could. Doctors sadly have to prepare you for the worst and give you all the risks.

"You will have to deliver this baby naturally"

"You will have a labour, you'll need to push"

"She will be tiny, but yours"

"She will be born in Ward 6 when we can get you in.

Maree is obviously just lost for words at this point. I cannot imagine what must have been going through her mind she was going to have a baby at 17 weeks. That's halfway, like surely there must be other options? There are, but highly not recommended... I already knew this from the reading prior. I again already knew it wasn't going to happen straight away.

### You may bleed, and there may be complications

"If you lose a lot of blood, we'll need to give you blood," she said in her detailed plan of what delivery would look like.

Maree went from being scared and confused to worried and fearful. I said something about blood being about making sure you're topped up, and it's a good thing I donated the other day (last Thursday)... She smiled; that worked.

"When would you like this to happen? I can leave the room now if you'd like to discuss."

We didn't need her to leave the room, we just looked at each other and knew.

"ASAP," we both said.

That was the first time in a long time that I felt like Maree and I were in sync again. It was comforting in this shittiest and awful situation possible.

## "Be right back"

I knew that meant nothing, well-trained thanks to Mum and Dad keeping me in these places the years prior. I didn't think much of it and got back to sitting on the computer chair I stole from the workstation nearby.

An hour passed, and Maree was trying to snooze but how do you snooze in this situation. I don't think she did, but I remember looking at her with eyes closed feeling for her so much. I started to cry not just for our baby at this point but for her too. I was scared. I'm glad she didn't see my tears at that point.

Maree and I are honestly exhausted by this point. I think the last time we ate was lunchtime and now it's 12:30am on Wednesday, May 15th. Maree is worried about Leila, she told her when she left her at Baba's [her mum's] that she was only going to the shops.

I said we could get some McDonalds on the way home.

"You can have gluten", I said, inferring Maree's gluten intolerance.

"You can eat what you want now", I added.

As soon as I said that, I felt horrible. It felt like I was making light of this situation. I wasn't, I was just trying to be kind, compassionate, and supportive.

"Yeah I guess so", Maree replied.

The doctor finally returns.

"Firstly, I'm so sorry for being late. I know I said I'd be right back".

"Okay, so I have some paperwork I need you to fill out Maree, we'll see you here at Ward 6 on Thursday at 2pm".

Maree signs and fills out the paperwork. It's the consent form for surgery. It includes words like significant bleeding, blood transfusions, and potential need for hysterectomy.

That last word was conflicting for me. I was the one who wanted this baby so much back at the end of last year. Now we're in this situation and it could be the situation to end all chances... I snapped myself out of it at that point; focus on Maree I remember telling myself.

"Oh and before you leave, you need to take a tablet to prepare for delivery". The doctor said.

A few minutes later, a midwife comes in with the tablet, it's [Mifepristone](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/postmarket-drug-safety-information-patients-and-providers/questions-and-answers-mifepristone-medical-termination-pregnancy-through-ten-weeks-gestation#:~:text=Mifepristone%20is%20a%20drug%20that,of%20the%20last%20menstrual%20period\).). I'm glad the midwife didn't say anything to Maree and Maree just took it. I don't know if she would have taken it if she had known it's the same tablet to take to medically abort babies still alive. I feel guilty that I didn't tell her either as I feel like I should have. Again, this rope to walk is so darn hard and I am utterly crushed at this moment. A husband's job is to support and love unconditionally, but it feels like I'm making exceptions to make it easier for Maree, medically over spiritually.

Those two, just don't mix well together.

## The drive to get Leila and go home

The drive home was quiet, both shock and tears. We got the McDonalds at Farrington Road and Maree has caved in and asked for a medium chocolate milkshake.

We get my food and our drinks. Before I get myself sorted (I was driving), Maree has already taken a sip. I get my drink and put it out to cheer her. I don't know why I did it, but we clinked our cups, took a drink and just cried til the time we got to Maree's mum and dad's place in Spearwood.

Both Maree and I have keys to our parent's homes on our key rings. I think that's a good sign of close families. It's 2am by this point and I open the back verandah door, then the laundry door which immediately stops because of a chain. It makes a large bang.

Well if they were asleep in there, they're certainly awake now. I remember thinking.

I walk in and our beautiful Leila is sleeping on a mattress on the floor in the lounge room. I pick her up, take her into my arms, and put her in the car seat while Maree talks to her mum and sister Debra, who kindly slept with Leila til we got her, for a little bit.

We said a quick goodbye and went home and went to bed. It's 3:05am
