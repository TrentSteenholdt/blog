## The last day

Sleep wasn't great. How could it be?

I remember hearing Leila and Maree 'wake' up too. Maree will most of the time move to Leila's room if Leila is unsettled but being so early [late] Maree slept with Leila as soon as we got home. Tears started to flow in my eyes while in bed. I just remember dreading it all and knowing that from tomorrow what was four in this home, will be back to three. **That hurt me.**

Maree came in to see me, she was in tears. She asks,

"Could I go to church this morning? I could take Leila"

"No I'll have boo [Leila], you go". I replied.

"Oh okay then. I'll go to my mum's then too if that's okay?" she enquired.

"Yep, not a problem", I again replied.

When Maree left for church, it was just Leila and me. Leila is absolutely the best and she has been (except on Mother's Day) so important in this whole journey. I simply cannot imagine what we would be going through if Leila didn't exist. I have my doubts Maree and I would have made it this far. For neither of us being 'clucky', I cannot imagine my life without her.

That for me is what makes this so hard for me. My life with Leila is so complete, but baby #2 was going to make me whole. I had such much hope but now there is... well, now. Tears were held for moments with

Leila, as best as they could be.

## It's wrong

**\>> This is an update to the story.** It goes to show that your mind is absolute mush and plays tricks on you. The above excerpt actually happens the next day (Thursday 16th May). Instead, all I can remember from Wednesday morning is my Dad messaging me if I needed anything and I just replied.

"Wednesday night dinner, keep it normal"

"Get mum to look after Leila tomorrow" I added.

That's it. My memory of Wednesday, May 15th is all a blur. I just remember it had a lot of tears for the most part.

## The rest of the day, a Wednesday Night Dinner like no over

In the afternoon, I go into data-boy for a little bit and find the internal documents of King Edwards Memorial Hospital that are given to midwives for training them in procedures and policies for delivering stillborns and babies of gestational age older than 13 weeks.

I organise logistics with my mum about looking after Leila and helping with the housework while we're away. We have failed to keep on top of it and our home is always spotless; not at this moment.

I feel technically prepared. But not mentally prepared; how can you be?

My mind wonders for Maree. I feel immensely for her; what hurt she has right now.

Dad cooks a private 'Wednesday Night Dinner' for Maree [with baby], Leila and me. Steak, sausages, spaghetti. A stalwart of tradition for us is Wednesday Nights at 'Radney'. It felt like a last supper of sorts. Dad cooks the best food out of all the Steenholdt's. It's very tasty but tasteless at the same time.

### Oh, shoot. What about a TENS machine

Maree when she delivered Leila did it without an epidural. An incredible feat of pain management, but also a telltale indication of her fear of anything medical. What she did use was a TENS Machine.

I remember thinking and saying out loud at dinner.

"Oh crap, what about a TENS machine".

Maree eyes said it all, she really wanted one but thought it was too late to organise one.

Not for me; I'm incredible with this stuff. I always have the answer. I Google search, find a place down the road that has them and call. 10 minutes, one sad phone call later "Oh congratulations.." "Yeah no, sorry", I have an address for pick up.

I drop Maree and Leila off and I go to get the TENS Machine. I ask Chade to come with me just to chat. Loneliness is hard at this point. We had a good chat about delivery and birth as he's about to become a Dad soon in July. He tries to talk about Mother's Day, but nope; not now, the focus is on what's next.

### Sleep

It's now 10pm, Maree is off to bed and Leila has been asleep for a few hours now. I don't feel tired, but I feel a sudden urge to get this off my chest. I started writing this whole story... that's when I started with [part one](/2024/05/16/a-journey-like-no-other-turner-syndrome-loss-a-fathers-story-1/).
