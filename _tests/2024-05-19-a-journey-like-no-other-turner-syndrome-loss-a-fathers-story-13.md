## On the morning of May 16th

It was about 3am when I decided I had finished writing this story so far, up to about part [six](/2024/05/16/a-journey-like-no-other-turner-syndrome-loss-a-fathers-story-6/). I also had a draft version of [the letter penned ready for the right time](/2024/05/17/dear-ivie-a-letter-to-my-daughter-that-was-taken-too-soon/); this brought on so many tears every time I reread it. I needed sleep and I felt exhausted by the point. It was also the day when my baby girl was coming into the world. The writing helped me seriously unwind a lot of emotion that was in me though it didn't cure me, nothing would.

I was awoken again by the sound of Maree and Leila. Same as the morning before, tears immediately flowed knowing what we knew was going to be an incredibly difficult day.

It was actually this day that Maree went to church... I got my days wrong... It's all a blur. Read **The last day** section in part [twelve](/2024/05/18/a-journey-like-no-other-turner-syndrome-loss-a-fathers-story-12/).

When Maree was at church and I was alone with Leila, I was really hurting. I remember needing to reach out for help...

## Sisters, Chade, Lain, Steph, Mum, Dad, Craig and Andrew

Throughout Tuesday night (two days earlier), I was secretly messaging one of my best mates Lain, a way for almost me to share my weight and tell my story. For the days and weeks prior it had been him, Andrew a cricket umpiring former work friend, Maree's sisters, Steph Maree's best friend/cousin, my Mum, my psychologist Craig and Chade, my younger brother. All have played roles they didn't know they had.

- Lain, unwinds, rants and updates. Share the frustration and anger. Someone with little faith so similar to me with rationale and thinking. _Irony we met at a Catholic University._

- Maree's sisters. For Maree support sharing and updates. Keep informed, use a bit of their 'hopium' (they'll say Faith) but it was still so great to receive their positivity knowing they were giving that to Maree all the way.

- Steph, one of Maree's closest friends and by that a great friend of mine. She has been the Maree distraction she's needed. She's also heard so much of my side of the story and has been a place to timestamp everything (the chats are often very long and one-sided; sorry).

- Chade. Grounded, a man of reason and provides excellent perspective from my family, but not 'rough' like the Steenholdt family can be.

- Mum, is Leila's support person when it's too hard for me and Maree. An excellent distraction from it all.

- Dad, he is my hero. I know I'm a splitting version of him, he's been through so much in the last year and faced loss like no one else [suicide, first wife]. I use him to know I can do this all too.

- Craig, my psychologist. Our last few sessions have just been a place to cry it all out and continue to remind myself to live the moment.

- Andrew, is my emergency go-to as he works from home and is always available for me. He is also someone with Catholic faith so he can also help me understand what Maree might be trying to say in the last few months.

It was Andrew that I needed, it was at very short notice.

Maree comes home, and I immediately go to Jayleas.

## We hug

**Men should hug more often.** If you're reading this story and you're hurting for whatever reason. Just do it. It honestly heals the heart. I felt soothed again and again. Andrew is also taller than me so it really does feel like I'm 'receiving' the hug.

We order coffee, and he pays (thank you). We sit down; I unload.

What was meant to be 30 minutes ends up being nearly an hour. I go in and spare no detail. People come in and out of the cafe and see me in tears. I don't care.

People hear me say things like "We lost our baby, she's gone", they look in shock. I don't care.

## Andrew tells me about Peter

A former work friend, Peter. He, unknown to me, just lost his daughter Aurelia not long before we lost our baby. Aurelia was diagnosed with [Edwards syndrome](https://www.healthdirect.gov.au/edwards-syndrome-trisomy-18#:~:text=Edwards%20syndrome%20is%20a%20genetic,before%20or%20soon%20after%20birth.); again data-boy me knows all about it.

I reach out to Peter. I offer my condolences first and foremost and offer the hand you don't think you need to give... "Mate, I'm about to walk the same path, I'm terrified".

Peter gave me some more answers to logistical things like whether I would be able to stay the night etc. Just knowing this stuff helped me prepare so much more. I needed to prepare; it's just who I am. In those moments I was able to pack my bag for the night(s) ahead, though my head was clearly not on right as I didn't pack the right things, but I can excuse myself.

His offer to get a beer soon to chat about what we've been through is something I plan to take him up on. I know it will be cathartic.

## 16 is an important number

Maree this morning is calm and collected following church, at least externally. Sure there is moments of some tears but nowhere near as much as I thought there would be. Incredible I just kept thinking to myself. How is she able to have this level of strength. Again people will say it's her faith, but I'll say that's not true... It's who she is, which includes faith, but it's her that has the strength...

She brings up in conversation.

"Today is the 16th of May. That's really important as Aunty Ivy passed on the 16th of June", she said.

"Oh, that's really nice", knowing what she was referring to.

## I'm hurting, Ivie

**Ivie.** It's the name we've decided for our baby girl. It wasn't a name we had picked early in pregnancy, but it was a name Maree came up with when we were around 13 weeks. I immediately loved it, even though I didn't know the modern spelling version Maree wanted at the time. When she told me that, I loved it even more.

This will show the inner workings of my brain... I have rules for everything and that's the same for names... Here are my three rules for a girl's name... They are very peculiar.

1. **It has to sound sweet, and kind.**
    - Some girls' names I feel are quite strong and bold... just simply not a fan.

3. **It has to be only two syllables.**
    - We will always name our kids with the middle name of Stedul, so it will stay with them for life. That name is very important to Maree. My last name Steenholdt also means "Stone" and "To keep/hold" in Danish so it is a strong name. Hence I feel the name needs to be short, sound sweet and kind.

5. **It has to be nice to write, cursively.**
    - Yep, this is an odd one, I know. I love cursive writing, and I think a girl's name should be smooth to write with no pen ever leaving the paper to finish it. If you can think about the cursive of Leila, you'll know what I mean.

This brought me back to earlier in the pregnancy when we didn't know Ivie was unwell. Maree and I had another name that I immediately wasn't sold on but I just remember how I would, with Leila's textas, draw cursively the name on her large plastic 'whiteboard'. Sometimes with her and even times without Leila there. I would be doing it literally hundreds of times, Maree sometimes laughing at me doing it.

It was a moment of pure excitement for me each time I did it (it was obsessive). I was living a moment knowing dreaming about the baby girl (if it was a girl) with that name arriving in late October. Instead, here I am thinking about Ivie and my baby girl's birth in May.... That was hard.

## It's just before 1pm

Our Mums arrive. They're ready to look after Leila. Maree has also packed her bags too. I feel like she has packed more than she did when we had Leila; that's fine, I did the same.

That 30 minutes or so with our Mums was so peaceful and calming to the soul. It's a moment that will live with me forever as I know they're both hurting in their own ways too.

It's now 1:15pm, it's time to go. My car is already parked out the front to not be blocked in. We hug our mums, hug Leila who is cheerful and so happy. This will be our first night where we don't have Leila; a milestone I wish we had in different circumstances.

We walk out the front door, bags in hand. We walk down the driveway which feels longer than ever before. We get to my car, Maree's dad coincidentally is driving past after dropping off Maree's mum earlier. He beeps, it snaps me out of it.

"That's nice," I think I said.

Maree was happy too.
