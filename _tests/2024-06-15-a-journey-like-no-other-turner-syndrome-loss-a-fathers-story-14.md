## We arrive at the hospital

Maree and I are always punctual people, so our arrival on time (/2pm) was bang on. We knew from experience that parking at King Edwards is a nightmare too so we catered for that and the walk.

We arrived at Ward 6 at King Edwarda and it's awfully quiet for a public hospital. The ward has like thirty beds but I reckon only about six of them were used. The receptionist felt very clinical and cold, so I was feeling nervous for Maree at this point that this could be a traumatic experience compounded by some off-putting people. Thankfully, I couldn't have been more wrong.

## Kathryn

We are invited to our room by the receptionist. Into the back corner and what felt like was away from everyone else. We kind of got ourselves settled and the first thing I noticed was the modern look of such an old Hospital. That was nice, though the site of no bed or couch for me wasn't great... Not that I was in any position to complain at this point.

A few minutes after settling in, a short and experienced midwife walks into the room

"Hi Maree and is it Trent? I'm Kathryn, I'm your dedicated midwife for today", she introduces herself.

What followed was the nicest, kindest and emphatic conversation I think Maree and I will ever have with a midwife again. She knew all the right things to say and when to say them. She prepared us for what to expect and when it happens what to expect.

## Details

In bullet point form, the information shared was very thorough.

- Kathryn was our dedicated midwife. In terms of her duties, her only patient was Maree.

- She would stay with us until her shift ended which was about 9pm. From there another midwife would take over.

- Maree had several drugs prescribed to her, from Panadol Forte to morphine for pain management. She was also prescribed [Lorazepam](https://www.webmd.com/drugs/2/drug-8892-5244/lorazepam-oral/lorazepam-oral/details) for sleeping; the 'good stuff' if you've used it before!

- We'd expect the drugs that help induce labour to aid in delivery in less than 24 hours. Anything longer than that, they forewarned that surgery might be the best option forward.

- The medication to induce, [misoprostol](https://thewomens.r.worldssl.net/images/uploads/fact-sheets/Preparing-for-your-procedure-with-Misoprostol_.pdf), would be delivered in a manner you'd rather not it to be delivered; every 4 hours.

- The biggest concern is not delivering the baby, but rather delivering the placenta. In terms of timing, they want the placenta delivered within 30 minutes of the baby's delivery. If it is any longer, then there is the concern of bleeding out.

- Blood loss could be a concern during the delivery of the baby, the placenta or at any time leading up to that. The magic number is 400ml. If Maree is to lose more than that, it's immediately onto blood transfusions.

The amount of detail was overwhelming but also so well explained, thanks again to Kathryn. I must admit when we were told morphine, I was surprised she could be in that much pain, but I suppose, after all, this is like any other delivery...

I remember confirming at this point too that it was okay for Maree to use her TENS machine. Kathryn was like "Of course, do whatever you need". It felt so foreign to treat this like any normal delivery, but know that it was anything but that.

## First dose at 4pm, and the spooky text

For the first two hours, it was mostly Kathryn explaining things to us and prepping some of the first bits of paperwork. I had my laptop so I was using this time to continue writing this story, up to part [eight](/2024/05/16/a-journey-like-no-other-turner-syndrome-loss-a-fathers-story-8/). Though, at about 3pm, I got the spookiest of texts you could get... It read.

### Blood donation

"Hi Trent, thank you for your B+ blood donation!

This donation was just as vital as all others from you before it. In fact, it could be giving life to someone soon as it's already on its way to King Edwards Memorial Hospital.

Thanks, Lifeblood"

Last Thursday, I donated my B+ blood thinking nothing of it. Little did I know my blood was now at King Edwards Hospital. What's even spookier about this is Maree's blood type is also B+. I remember telling Maree my blood was just donated to Sir Charles Gardner down the road; another blatant lie as I couldn't dare to scare her with that information.

You can't not but think that maybe, Maree is about to get my own blood if this all goes awry?! Fuck, that's spooky.

The first drugs are administered at 4pm exactly; that wasn't planned but just when everything was all sorted. We now begin the wait for Ivie...
