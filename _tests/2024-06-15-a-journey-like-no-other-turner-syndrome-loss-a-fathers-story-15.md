## The lead in

It's about 6pm and the drugs Maree took a couple of hours earlier are not having much impact. In fact, I remember continually asking Maree if there was anything and she would come back with the same.

"Nope nothing, I'm fine, pain is like a 0", she'd say.

This was expected though part of me really thought something should be happening. However, Kathryn assured us this was completely normal and that it could take a few rounds of the medication to help with 'induction' and 'labour'.

The dinner lady came past with our meals. Maree is gluten-free so there was a concern earlier she could get nothing, but thankfully it was a beef stir fry that was marked as gluten-free. For a hospital meal, it was pretty tasty and logistically, they were able to cater for Maree's needs with little notice.

The only issue we had so far was the confirmation that the ward's ice machine was broken, something Maree loved when giving birth to Leila. I suppose we'll have to skip.

7pm passes and Maree starts to feel cramping. When she said this, I jumped onto a WhatsApp group that I created for Maree's sisters and my mum and dad to get delayed updates of what was happening. Delayed intentionally because I wanted to make sure my focus was always on Maree, or if nothing was happening, my own writing.

Unfortunately at this time, Debra, one of Maree's sisters asked if I could add Maree's mum to the chat. It was my hope that the sisters would be the ones to relay the information to Maree's mum (Ann) when they felt appropriate, but that relay was shorted. This meant instead of being a chat where all I wanted to do was provide updates, sometimes very detailed, I became conscious of what I could really share without worrying her; as she is a worrier like Maree. Thankfully though, I didn't let this be too much of a distraction and I sure didn't tell Maree my 'conflict'. It is honestly a 0 to her 100 right now.

At 8pm, Maree is given her second round of drugs. The cramping that was building up has now subsided again; odd I thought. Kathryn preps us for her departure and says our next midwife will be in shortly.

## Lily

At about 9pm, a younger midwife enters the room and introduces herself.

"Hi Maree and Trent, I'm Lily, I'll be the midwife for the night shift.", she said.

Lily is a name important to Maree and me. It's the name of our first goddaughter, Steph's daughter. It was somehow comforting for whatever reason. Maybe some familiarity? I'm not sure, but it was. When she wrote her name on the whiteboard, it was even more comforting... Why? Because it was in cursive.

At around 10:30pm Maree is just lying down, eyes closed with not much in terms of difference for when she'd normally be sleeping. The only difference is the clothes she's wearing, a hospital maternity robe, and the environment, a dark and empty ward.

Lily comes in and out to check on Maree. At this point, Maree starts to believe she had maybe taught Lily before at the school where she worked out. I just told Maree to ask her next time she's in, but she didn't have the courage at first. Again I wasn't going to push her, though eventually Maree did ask. In the end, the whole interaction just made Lily confused and awkward. Maree can sometimes ask in very roundabout ways... No harm done though, Lily was still great and professional.

## Delivery

It's now drawing nearer to midnight, May 17th, time for the third round of drugs. It was the actual date I initially wrote in my draft letter to Ivie; maybe some foreshadowing? Lily administers the medication slightly ahead of schedule (11:30pm) and encourages Maree to get some sleep as it could be a long night. The offer of Lorazepam is given, but Maree declines. She knows well of its effects as she's seen me take them a couple of times dealing with Dad in 2023.

When you're administered misoprostol, you're encouraged to lay still so for the next hour. Maree is like a plank. She is one to always follow simpler instructions from doctors and nurses.

I remember asking her again like I had for much of the night already...

"What's your pain out of 10?", I'd repeat.

"Ah, hrrm, probably a 2.", she replied.

A 2 was significant because for the most part, besides some mild cramping, her pain was always a 0. I remember thinking that maybe we're getting close. No more than 15 minutes later, I ask here again.

"Hrrm, yeah probably a 4 now.", Maree said, while wiggling a little bit.

At this point, I encourage Maree to take some pain medication. Begrudgingly and somewhat coerced by Lily, she takes some Panadol Forte.

It's now around 12:30am, and Maree implies she has an urge to go to the toilet. I ask her if she wants to put on the TENS machine after using the toilet and she agrees its a good idea. For a few more minutes Maree lays in bed until she's ready to go, around 12:45am.

Maree enters the bathroom, leaves the door open so I can see her and puts the requested pan in the toilet bowl. That pan is to effectively catch anything...

At 12:50am, Maree is just on the toilet, not doing a great deal. My back is to her as I'm writing this story in my laptop.

"Ah, ohh, I feel something", Maree quickly quips.

## I hit the button

I don't hesitate. I've been in hospitals for too long to know that pressing the 'nurse page' button means nothing, especially at 12:50am. I immediately hit the 'alert' button; effectively the code blue.

I can hear Lily and another nurse running from the nurse's station. At the same time, I can hear Maree.

"Ohh", Maree quips.

No longer later, maybe 10 seconds, I hear a sound that will stay with me for life. The sound of Ivie hitting the cardboard pan in the toilet. A dull thud but soft at the same time.

Lily by this time is in the room cancelling my naughty press of the alert button. She's also telling the other nurse everything is okay. Maree is squatting over the toilet. You can't but not help and look. All I can see is an empty umbilical cord from Maree, to Ivie's belly. I could tell Ivie was being kind of hung from it; it was not like Leila's delivery at all. I did what people told me to do at this point when dealing with pregnancy loss; I took a photo.

Lily is at this point confirming everything.

"Yep, you've just delivered the baby", she confirmed while clamping and cutting the umbilical cord.

Maree is in a state of shock and relief. Delivery of Ivie was nothing like Leila...

## 30 minutes on the clock

After confirming Maree was okay and Maree was back in bed, I messaged the WhatsApp group that Ivie was here. Ivie and her pan was removed from the toilet. Lily takes her away to bathe her for us. While I saw a glimpse of Ivie at this point (belly), Maree chose not to look until after she was cleaned up.

Now the clock was started, we needed the placenta and hopefully intact.

Maree's blood loss is closely monitored. It's minor at the moment, like 66ml. Lily is extremely happy.

No more than 12 minutes later, Maree says she needs the toilet again. She prepares a new pan in the toilet. I hear her make a similar sound to before.

"Somethings coming", she said.

I don't press the alert button this time, but I do press the nurse page and in the dark hallway of the ward call out for Lily. At the time I went to the door to say that, Maree had delivered the placenta.

Lily inspects the placenta, and she says.

"Looks like it's intact". An important fact when at this gestational age and when you've already lost your baby.
