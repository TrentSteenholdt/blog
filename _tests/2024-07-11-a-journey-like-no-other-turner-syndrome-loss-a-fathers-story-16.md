## Seeing Ivie

After delivery, Ivie wasn't in our arms straight away like any normal delivery. Rather, taken away and bathed from the blood etc. Lily, our midwife, came in not long after the placenta confirmation and asked if we wanted to see her.

"Yes please," we both said.

Ivie, was then handed over to us in a little wicker basket, just a fraction larger than a large tissue box. A cloth was draped over the basket so we couldn't see her straight away. As we put her down on the bottom of the bed, I suggested to Maree we get a recording going on one of our phones. Just so we have a memory of our first reactions.

As soon as set up the recording on the phone, I stood alongside the bed where Maree was sitting (at the top) and Ivie was placed at the bottom. Maree had the honour of revealing Ivie.

The next thing I saw was my raw Ivie. Raw was the best way to describe her. Her skin colour is not like anything you'd imagine, it is much darker, redder and again, raw. I remember looking and seeing her neck first, bulging and swollen. You could just tell the fluid was simply nowhere to go. Then it was her legs, I saw white in her little legs, only realising that was her femur bone, visible through the translucency of her skin.

## Reaction

My reaction was numbness, just feeling a bit lost in what I was seeing. For Maree, it was immediate grief and sorrow. That was hard to see her break down like that. After all, this was the first time we got to see Ivie, and it was raw, and it was sadly, very very still, for all of us.

We spent some good time with Ivie, checking her all over and picking her up in the basket. Neither of us was gain enough to take her out of the basket. She was too fragile for that we both thought.

## Smell

It was during the moment of spending time with her that my sense of smell really took notice of what was happening. I remember the smell of Leila when she was born and for any mum and dad out there, you'll know of that 'newborn' smell. For Ivie however, it sadly wasn't that; I actually knew what it smelt like. It smelt like death.

It was the smell of all things that made me realise once again that we had lost Ivie, the emotion of grief flooded my mind all over again.

## Rest of the morning

After a good 45 minutes to an hour with Ivie, Lily came in a took her away from us, as we requested. Lily assured us we could ask to see her at any point and bring her back into the room. At this point though it's pretty much 3am in the morning and Maree is exhausted. She says she wants to sleep.

I'm not sure if she did sleep, but I certainly didn't. I was running on fumes but my mind was racing.

By about 8am, I said I would go move my car (car parking for the next day was about to start) and go get some McDonalds for breakfast and a decent coffee. I got the coffee and some food for myself and took it back to the hospital. Now we're just waiting for the doctors who start their day shift to come in and see us.
